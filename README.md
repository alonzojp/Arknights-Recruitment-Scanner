# Arknights Recruitment Scanner

## Why did I make this?
"Arknights" is a gacha game where operators in the game are separated into different rarities. One feature in this game is called "Recruitment", a place where players can select certain "tags" that are assigned to various operators. By selecting very specific tag combinations, higher rarity units can be guaranteed. However, the list of combinations is very extensive and takes a while to manually go through, so I decided to create an application that can automatically scan and alert users if a beneficial combination is detected.

### How It Works:
As an example, we will use this in-game screenshot for demonstration purposes. Without knowing optimal combinations beforehand, a player would not know what tags to select.

When first opening the application, a user simply needs to set the file directory of where their screenshots are.

Once done, the user should take a screenshot of their recruitment screen and click on "Get Latest Screenshot". Depending on the tags they have, different outcomes will be displayed!

Using this information, a player can then mimic the tags displayed and recruit higher rarity operators more frequently.
